@UNmigration #Immigration into Europe is not necessary at all.

In terms of the objective measure, #carbonfootprint, Europe is 5x too full to be #sustainable.

What Europe needs is a population decrease, which is now happening naturally(!), and which your kind of organisations is frustrating.
These Mexicans coming across our border reminds me of the Goths on the Roman Danube. Look how that turned out. #BuildTheDamnWall #immigration #MAGA

@MrArronK @heavencrawley (7/7) [https://t.co/Rn9U6ipuci]) made a #documentary released 8 years ago on the problem, which I must add hasn't gone away.  #immigration #brexit #ukpoli #uspoli #centralamerica #latinamerica #railtravel #migration #BrexitReality
@MrArronK @heavencrawley (3/) #brexit is unlikely to cut #immigration simply because there has always been a border between the #uk proper and #france that many migrants have been able to cross by boat in the backs of trucks.

Interior enforcement of labor &amp; immigration laws, not further border militarization, is what works.

DT is correct to use our military to secure our southern border. US pays $138,000,000,000 a year paying for illegals. Enough!

GOP wants illegals for cheap labor.

Dems want illegals for votes.

DT wants to protect the American worker/citizen.
Pregnant women, unaccompanied minors, people with chronic illnesses, and the elderly are considered vulnerable populations who will possibly be given permits to stay in the country. #viacrusis #refugees #immigration

The bs of #quotas aside:

Avg judge does 678 cases a year.

Quota is to deport 700 a year...

That means you‚Äôd need to clear more total cases than avg and have 100% of them warrant deportation.

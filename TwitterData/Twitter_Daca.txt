@realDonaldTrump Have you even read the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act? Or maybe asked an objective reader (e.g., an IG) to provide a summary? Or is knowing it was a policy passed under @BarackObama's Admin all that you require to determine if legislation is inherently "bad." #DACA
#DACA #Hispanics are now learning the hard way, as #Black people should have learned after 8 yrs under #Obama, the 1st so-called "Black" President, and many years of the #Democratic #Congressional #Black #Caucus, the #Dems are only interested in them as swing #voting blocs. https://t.co/SGyfMevRXk
Do not confuse #DACA with the #Dems proposal of the #DreamAct. One allows up to 1.8 million to earn citizenship in exchange for a big, beautiful border wall and the other, legalizes nearly 11 million illegals in #Amnesty.

Trump does not want more US citizens who will vote against him - thus, he is deporting #DACA

Two days ago, @USCIS released a ton of new data on #DACA renewals pursuant to a court order. Here is one of the files posted online that contains a startling new data point. https://t.co/hZRwauzrnG /2
New research shows #DACA reduces teen pregnancy and improves education outcomes: https://t.co/ixxqNd1pqI @olgakhazan
For affected population group, #DACA is associated w/ 15% increase in HS grad rates, 45% decline in teenage births, &amp; 25% increase in college attendance among women: https://t.co/KpYp0ZJ2DF

A few of the many reasons CFC leaders are calling for a permanent solution for #Dreamers.
If you completely ignore the fact that @BarackObama made #DACA with an illegal EO, and that @realDonaldTrump did the right thing and put it back in the hands of the people, through their representatives, of which @TheDemocrats #resisted instead of negotiating. https://t.co/3PQMC9iLjn

@ananavarro #DACA failed the moments Obama overstepped his authority and put it in place. The Democrat's inability to work with Republicans, who had presented a balanced proposal, doesn't make this a Republican failure. Your hyper partisanship and hatred of Trump clouds you ability to think.

@WenBeck5 @Skippeachicky @ihatethemedia @KamalaHarris @SenateGOP @HouseGOP That was the point of #DACA b4 Trump fucked it up. Even with bipartisan support for a fix he still refused to sign it.
He's just a racist asshole.  Remember his father didn't come here legally either and FLOTUS has her own visa violations.

When Trump says "work with me", he only means "cave in to my demands".
Asking for bipartisan solutions, he opposed:
- 6 separate bipartisan bills to solve the #DACA problem he caused
- 4 bills for bipartisan immigration reform
- A bipartisan healthcare reform bill
He lies.

To claim migrants are trying to abuse #DACA betrays a total misrepresentation of what the program is, and Trump knows this.  Because of Trump, the program is no longer accepting applicants. Even if it were, these migrants would not be remotely eligible.  https://t.co/os3UUcFCzs
But the purposeful deceit needs to stop.  Two examples from just this week.  His criticisms of Amazon for harming the #USPS &amp; claiming a caravan of immigrants are hoping to take advantage of #DACA are blatantly false, and he knows it.  They are meant to inflame his supporters

That‚Äôs kinda the point. We don‚Äôt want you here! #DACA I have too many legal immigrant friends who deserve to be here, illegals don‚Äôt. Chain migration = chain deportation. Tough. https://t.co/RFXN1Jejev

@realDonaldTrump #Illegals #DACA are #Democrats @chuckschumer ping pongs! Liberals who say they love ‚ù§Ô∏èimmigrants applaud @JimmyKimmelLive bigot remarks-smirking at immigrants English! Where is  @NBC @jorgeramosnews outrage? Are only liberal immigrants acceptable to #Democrats

@charliekirk11 Totally agree! That‚Äôs the reason they only include UNDOCUMENTED Dreamers in #DACA, while explicitly exclude #LegalDreamer: those who were brought to US as minors, but LEGALLY. UNDOCUMENTED is their vote-bank. Why exclude these #LegalDreamer https://t.co/3bNzUoo6gb @E2VisaReform

@RealRedElephant @grindall61 @ICEgov I would like to report Justino Mora seen in this video who voted in American elections as an ILLEGAL. This is a clear violation of #Daca requirements.
@charliekirk11 If @POTUS is The One to 'legitimize' them....there's #Democrats, 'fear.' (Wasn't #DACA an Exec Order by #Obama? Never passed through The Legislature.) POTUS has the ability to wipe it out then, with a pen stroke.

@CocoRococco LOL. There is a 2 year backlog so anyone deported in 2017 was determined to be for removal by Obama. CBP/ICE has stats on 'arrests' for 2017 and 92% of those aliens already had criminal convictions. The rest hadn't been processed yet. #DACA

#DACA DACA was an illegal executive order under dictator Obama and is not Constitutional. I emplore all Mexican border property owners to vigilant. The US is being invaded everyday and it must stop one way or another. Hopefully US military will be activated.

@RyanAFournier America can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can take care of the DACA issue and house our homeless Veterans and feed our hungry children. All one needs to do is look at what the corporate welfare Trump gave away and what that money could have done to solve both.

@DJKatie888 @RMConservative @CR @CRTV Considering that CBP seized more than 3.3 MILLION POUNDS of narcotics at Southern border back in 2015, and that estimates are that they maybe catch HALF.... how can there be any question about building a wall? #BuildTheWallNow #NoIllegals NO #DACA

@realDonaldTrump Donald please stop lying.

You ended #DACA protections out of the blue by EO

You rejected every bipartisan deal presented after stating you would accept any deal.

So we know you‚Äôre lying, please stop.

@MinGjones60 Not true. I'd check your sources if I were you. There were many 30 year olds who were accepted into #DACA. And BTW, god has nothing to do with US immigration law so that is the lamest excuse for letting damn mooching #Illegals walk all over Americans.
@RyanAFournier What about #DACA veterans and #Dreamers currently in military service?
‚ÄúLegislatively, even before the president‚Äôs tweets, we knew that there likely would not be action towards the program until after the midterm election..." #Trump declared ‚Äú#DACA is dead", blaming Democrats for failing to find a replacement. More here: https://t.co/GjcdhzjI10

Here are the facts on the #Dreamer crisis:
‚û°Trump offered a compromise on #DACA, Democrats refused.
‚û°Obama created this crisis by implementing DACA via an unconstitutional #ExecutiveOrder.
‚û°#Democrats don't want a solution for #Dreamers. They just want to pad their voter base. https://t.co/nHpO9BtKFi
@AstroTroy @realDonaldTrump US is a sovereign country. It means US controls who may or may not enter our country. But feel free to post up a list of other countries who let #Illegals waltz in without permission, park their arses, mooch education &amp; jobs. NO #DACA
@realDonaldTrump #DACA was fine until you ended it. There were many bipartisan efforts to save it, which you rejected. The buck stops with you. #IStandWithDreamers

@MinGjones60 I repeat. #DACA are not children and they themselves are 100% guilty of 'UNLAWFUL PRESENCE.' Has nothing to do with their lawbreaking parents. So no one is punishing them for actions of their parents, silly. Besides, many DACA were unaccompanied.

@loondale I love the Sovereign Territory of our borders however #DACA which has bipartisan support is to be fair to the children who were brought by the illegal actions of their parents. That's cruel to punish a child for the deed of their fathers and un-#Christian
#DACA the Biblical people's you refer to Jim, weren't trying to gain access to countries illegally and reap the benefits of sanctuary cities. They were in search of there own land...
Well I will be honest, these people's are not passing through and well this is Not their Land

It was a ploy from the beginning; if a dem was in the whitehouse, kick the can again, a rep? Blame it on them for ending because it was flawed from the beginning.

This goes further and deeper than building a wall. Trump is becoming more unhinged at a quicker pace, on a rampage attacking #DACA in the past few days. It goes further than even just the #Dreamers.

Roughly 694,000 people were enrolled in #DACA at the end of March, that is up from approximately 683,000 two months earlier.

Contrary to Trump's claims, DACA is not dead. Current recipients are still able to renew expired benefits

Now, everybody knows Pelosi, Schumer, DNC, etc. don't really care about #Dreamers at all, just using them as pawns in their political, ideological war.

@SenFeinstein  needs to be specific and share with the people exactly what Democrats offered at the table for #DACA - Along with what they offered equally for The Wall &amp; Immigration.  Words are CHEAP lady which is the Liberal way but for once give specifics of your accusations.

Trump's ignorance about #DACA is stunning @CNN https://t.co/1bDxSHDBWg  ---to be eligible for DACA, applicants must have lived in the US since 2007, have arrived before age 16, and been younger than 31 in June 2012.
@POTUS told Acosta that Democrats let down #DACA but that's not true. So, by Acosta asking "didn't you kill daca?"  That is a good reporter, IMO, b/c right then &amp; there, straighten that 'fib' out.

What a shameful treatment of DREAMers of whom about 106,000 live in Florida: https://t.co/FcBZp29G6c #pfla #DACA
@realDonaldTrump @CNN WHY DON'T YOU GET BACK TO ATTEMPTING TO BE THE ILLUSION OF A PRETEND PRESIDENT?! YOU HAVE NO JUDGEMENT WHATSOEVER AFTER SEEING HOW YOU SLAMMED DEMS WHILE SURROUNDED BY CHILDREN. YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLY INCOMPETENT. YOU HAVE NPD &amp; ADD. #IMPEACHTRUMP #DACA
Clearly Trump wants his absurd sexual assault and bribery scandals with multiple women out of the news so he latches on to #DACA and #Immigration
They tried to dismiss @realDonaldTrump as a joke, they tried sex, racism, misogyny, Russia collusion, obstruction, "blue star family" BS, #DACA, &amp; they attack his children, all #FAIL. NOW they are trying corruption. i.e. using #Roseanne (monetizing) &amp; @NyMag pig, #Desperate
#DACA #DREAMERS https://t.co/AqQyd7CI7c
Of course @potus @realDonaldTrump DOESN'T know what #DACA is. Like how NEW "caravan" of illegal immigrants CAN'T be part of DACA, b/c they were not living here in June 2007, which is the cut-off date to qualify for DACA status. But he doesn't let #FACTS get in way of #LIES. #SAD https://t.co/JvL6FtSqvc
#DACA led to 15% increase in HS grad rates, a 45% drop in teenage births, a 3% increase in attendance of HS-age students, and a 22% increase in college enrollment among Hispanic women. https://t.co/8vjYFfZ8Js

@chjones454 @SenFeinstein What are you talking about? There is NO pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. If only they could just take a test! They'd do it in a heartbeat. #DACA https://t.co/NLGvgr4cpj

@jim_fowlds @ItsMeCathi I would be surprised, considering #DACA get community college tuition help sometimes, but #DACADreamers fees are $500 every 2 years plus legal expenses and it means paying taxes and letting #ICE know your address. Price is nearly equal &amp; less scary paying tuition outright.

Donald Trump ended the #DACA program 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ days ago.

So far his admin + GOP Leadership has refused 6Ô∏è‚É£ bi-partisan DACA deals from Congress.

Happy Tuesday!
@Acosta Funny that you are "just doing your job" for @realDonaldTrump but were nothing but a lapdog for @BarackObama. You can't be a reporter if you think some apples are apples and some apples are bananas. Besides #democrats killed #DACA. This is the essence of #FakeNews.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS @realDonaldTrump revoked #DACA in September 2017. You're literally lying about this.

And you were going to help #DACA to encourage more illegals to cross the border just to be ‚Äúnice‚Äù. There is no consequences for illegal immigration. We voted for you and the wall and send illegals back. You say they could come back legally but they are still here

@CoreyLMJones Liberals think #DACA is the responsibility of Republicans. Half true. It‚Äôs the responsibility of America as it affects everybody. But like Obamacare, DACA is a creation of Democrats, and they alone are to blame for its existence.
@FoxNews @PressSec @POTUS @foxandfriends 1. #Trump cancelled #DACA himself. Noone else.
2. When presented with a bipartisan deal he said: no
3. Trump can save the DACA deal himself without congress.
4. Republicans have majority in both congress and senate
@SenFeinstein @SenFeinstein you are wrong.  #Obama created #DACA in 2012 to secure more votes in his Last WIN.  DEM‚Äôs started this to use them politically.  Then found Any excuse Not to approve Deal , to use them again.  Make Deal for boarder get DACA.  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenateDems  DOIT

We work FULL TIME JOBS, and still owe more taxes at the end of the year so they can have their dream.

What about our dream for all our hard work?

It‚Äôs crazy to think that in the last six years #DACA recipients have nearly paid roughly $1.2 billion dollars in simply renewing their paperwork to be able to work &amp; go to school. I don‚Äôt want to make it seem like everyone else isn‚Äôt paying for things but that just to be able..
@NewsHour @ericarhendry @vicpasquantonio #DACA illegal aliens hold 20,000 teacher jobs. Is being a teacher a job "that Americans don't want to do?"

Want higher pay? Deport illegal aliens that are competing for your jobs and driving down your wages. #BuildTheWall #OklahomaTeachers #maga

@GOP @PressSec @POTUS Idiots, the #MoronInChief tried to end #DACA on 9/5/2017, however, the courts have thankfully stopped the asshat in his tracks. Only @realDonaldTrump is to blame, not the Dems #TrumpCrimeFamily
@realDonaldTrump You really are an idiot and should read SOMETHING before you talk. "Big flows of ppl" cannot take advantage of #DACA and if you had ever even bothered to read it, you'd know that. You're a liar, a con man and the biggest #FoolOnTheHill
@SenFeinstein Sen Feinstein... 87% of Trump supporters wanted a wall.

DACA was offered, but the wall is a must. Fixing the problem for future generations.

So, I doubt much he‚Äôll do anything for those kids.
@chillibeanboy @POTUS I‚Äôve already ‚Äúdone my homework.‚Äù #DACA was lawfully rescinded because it was an overstep of exec power by Obama.

@CNN He would have had the one he offered months ago, multiple times,  allowing nearly 2 mil DACA recipients amnesty, if democrats could put aside petty partisan politics. But they are either too bitter, too ignorant or don't actually care about the DACA recipients. Or all 3. #DACA

@SenFeinstein Sen, you can try to spin whatever you want, Pres. put a deal together for 1.8 mil to have a pathway to citizenship. He was not going to sign anything deemed illegal by the courts, which is what #Obama #DACA order was ruled. #Democrats walked away.
One thing is VERY CLEAR. If you give a #Liberal an inch, they will take a mile! Gay marriage? Transgender sickos shares bathrooms with children. #DACA? "Open the borders for ALL" These sick perverted lib (so called) humans MUST be stopped and expelled to another country. Planet?
Mister president said #DACA is dead
you remind me of someone people asked him to go to church to PRAY to
to remove SINS on him but inside doesn't want to pray finally he went  and found the church closed and said see its closed and he was happy and said Daca is Dead

@SenatorDurbin The #DACA program, done through unlawful executive order, was rightly ended. I do not want the non-violent deported. I want you jackass congressmen to do your highly overpaid jobs &amp; provide a lawful means for those people.
@SenFeinstein Obama knew when he created DACA that it is the job of congress to legislate, -not the president and yet he went forward with it anyway.

#DACA  Do not be fooled by Pelosi. You would never had a chance for legal status, and certainly not citizenship by Exec order. Only Congress can do that, and they would have never even attempted it if President Trump had not stopped the Exec order.
@realDonaldTrump #DACA ?  You cancelled it, right?

@rosieperezbklyn I get you are upset @rosieperezbklyn but you cannot give blame all to Trump. Democrats were given a deal but they refused to help the #DACA #Dreamers. America cannot continue to have unlawful immigrants.
Stop with these facts and reason. Just stop it!

#MAGA and the deplorables don't care about facts. They just care about making America hate again!

The caravan of "asylum seekers" coming from the south, IS a National security issue, @POTUS. Ive mentioned that #DACA advocates have been "acting like an invading army" by rioting in the streets until they get their way. End catch &amp; release. Its not a law.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS What I think doesn't matter, but... Dems wanted #DACA for votes. However, @Potus offered twice the number. Dems thought Daca kids would vote #Trump2020.  They let #DACA die.
@realDonaldTrump You‚Äôve done so well with #DACA, perhaps you should negotiate the next deal between #amazon and #USPS.
THIS IS A LIE!
President Trump was willing to help DACA IMMIGRANTS and YOU DEMOCRATS ALL refused to pass a #DACA BILL.

@realDonaldTrump has moved the goal posts so much on #DACA, they aren‚Äôt even located in the US anymore.
If Trump really wanted to fix his mistake for ending #DACA program, he could just sign an EO to fast track all these ppl into citizenship. They alrdy live here for yrs &amp; pay taxes. But of course, #RacistInChief will drag it out for months!

to Congress to decide what to do, not really making clear in the process what he wanted to see happen w/dreamers. Several court cases alleging that Trump illegally ended #DACA have made the March deadline moot, meaning dreamers already in DACA can renew their applications. But..

@TheDemocrats The America people didn't invite immigrants to come here illegally with their children without first trying to secure their children's citizenship. It's not our problem. The #DACA people should blame their parents.
Apparently the same person who terminated #DACA to use as a bargaining chip doesn‚Äôt even know the rules that it entails. https://t.co/WxRoj2VCOd
@realDonaldTrump You are a moron on an epic scale. Not only that you are a racist and are using these people as political pawns. Shame on you! You are the one who killed the DACA program and your constant flip flop make an immigration deal impossible. #TrumpIsAMoron #TrumpIsARacist #DACA
@Noorangeppl @Richzeoli @ANHQDC @LelandVittert @FoxNews 100% are here illegally is the only verifiable percentage.Dems had a chance to make a DACA deal granting a path to citizenship if only they would support the immigration reform requested by @POTUS.

#TheStory
The #Democrats didn‚Äôt end #DACA  #Trump did!  He is lying again and again!  Call him out on it. https://t.co/KSbchsZUaR
I continue 2 want 2 ‚Äúlash out irrationally‚Äù @ R absolutely stupid Prez! The @POTUS  is a member of the @GOP, House &amp; Senate R dominated by the @GOP...so how can he say #DACA  is the fault of the @TheDemocrats? He might think if he keeps saying it u will believe it!
Trump Is lying about the Democrats turning down the #DACA deal is because he wants Latinos to get mad at democrats and not for them in Nov. 2018 #hardball
Trump's Russia probe is heating up, and he's facing a strong lawsuit from Stormy Daniels. Renewing his push on immigration returns him to familiar ground and helps to rally the racists among his supporters around him at a time he needs them most.

#DACA Facts:

DACA restricts deportation of immigrants who came to the U.S. as children

DACA is only available to immigrants who have continuously resided in the U.S. since 2007

Immigrants must have been younger than 31 years old when DACA was announced

#immigration
Hey, .@realDonaldTrump, you canned #DACA and Democrats we‚Äôre willing to put wall into the CR if you reinstated DACA. You say you started and protected dreamers. Now you have what you always do: Nothing. #Moron
Did you forget that @BarackObama created an unconstitutional executive order that he proclaimed was #illegal? #Congress makes law and they had 7 months to fix it and failed becuase of you, no one else, just you.,,you owe all #DACA an apology... https://t.co/bGFFS30Xvq

It‚Äôs time to deport them &amp; put Americans first. Illegals are draining local &amp; state budgets while many Americans can barely make ends meet.
#SinclairBroadcasting had an Orwellian message. Trump is the only source of truth. Any media outlet that disagrees is #fakenews,a conspiracy to bring him down. So much for his bill of love #DACA. Symbolism of POTUS lost on him. world is watching #Hardball
#DACA is an #ExecutiveOrder it can be removed at any time and is not a #Law

Obama enacted it in 2012:--&gt;5-6 Years have passed...

'What percentage of those put under DACA in 2012 have applied for and are in the process of receiving Citizenship?'

The most frustrating thing about the #DACA debate with 45 is that he really doesn't understand what he is talking about or he is blatantly lying. Not sure which one is worse. You can't cross the border right now and get in on the DACA deal, that doesn't exist.
Will someone please inform #Trump that he is not #Goering  #Himmler or #Hitler - this is the USA.

No, it's a difficult thing for him because he has no heart! It was his executive order that disrupted #DACA

@Acosta Yes!! The President killed #DACA #IDIOT https://t.co/cUqnXQGQ1j
Most obvious reason is that Trump himself ended DACA.We all know that. Also know what he thinks of DACA.#DACAhttps://t.co/BtvgFq2H8O
@realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake There are those who seek office to work for good cause, and those who seek office for "ME ONLY" using deceitful and false promises to confuse &amp; divide US. A CON is unmistakable regardless. #Wolf #FoxNews #FoxandFriends #Maddow #CNN #MSNBC #DACA #BorderWall #Democrat #GOP #USA
Seemingly unaware that he's going to die penniless in prison, soon, Trump is racing toward the Biggest Asshole Ever Award. #DACA #TrumpRussia

@TomFitton #Mueller is running out of excuses. Over a year and no evidence of Trump collusion. The IG is about to drop a MOAB in the lap of the Democrats, just before the midterms. The Democrats don‚Äôt have a message or a policy and they lost on #DACA #BuildTheWall #Census2020 game over!
No, we do not #fear our enemies, but the opposite of fear is not opposition or exclusion. The opposite of fear is #love

I‚Äôd like to live in a country that protects the people that make it great. Like young immigrants who are American in every way that matters. According to Trump/ congressional Republicans this is too much to ask. Have they lost all empathy? #DACA

False. #trump unilaterally killed #DACA. The @gop allowed him to do it. https://t.co/wzrrGYEPNR
I am not a political expert.

But Christians are commanded to love their neighbor.
This is not loving your neighbor.
This is the opposite of loving them.

So, this is not Christ-like.
So we should not do it.

Huh, that was easier than I expected.

@realDonaldTrump @JeffFlake: "To say that "Democrats want no borders" is inaccurate. Every senate Democrat voted for bipartisan immigration legislation in 2013 that included $40+ billion for border infrastructure, personnel &amp; technology. Both sides of the aisle want reform. Let's do it." #DACA

Retweeted Jeff Merkley (@JeffMerkley):

As @realDonaldTrump tweets crocodile tears about #Dreamers, remember:

1) he ended #DACA to deport kids who are American in all but paperwork.

2) he has been clear that he cares... https://t.co/vVYrgaqUBQ
@RepStevenSmith @IngrahamAngle When will @davidhogg111 claim his white privelege and know rhat between #affirmativeAction and #metoo movement and all the #DACA kids and the #lgbtqh group he is the bottom of the barrel for being a straight white guy, if he identified as a wiman he just might get in to college.
Judges ought to be thorough. Setting quotas will pressure judges to see more cases, spend less time on issues, and issue rapid rulings. Wheels of justice should NOT move too hastily.

All my support to @Acosta after shouting #DACA questions to POTUS this morning. ¬°Estamos ah√≠ para hacer preguntas! If Trump doesn‚Äôt like questions, then he should control what he says on twitter.
#DACA  Here's the problem with getting this done... Not that it isn't doable but, that #POTUS can't decide who to listen to on a daily basis... Why you may ask?

Because he has been doing nothing but campaigning for Re-Election from almost the moment he swore the Oath...

@stonecold2050 Meanwhile, soon after announcing #DACA, tens of thousands of "unaccompanied alien children" (UAC) from South America flooded the southern US border.

In order to be #DACA eligible, before Trump terminated the program, you would need to be younger than 16 years of age at the time of arrival, and you must have resided in the US since June 15, 2007. No one is coming here to take advantage of DACA.

Besides everything else that's been said, what exactly does @POTUS mean when he says "Lots of people are coming in to try to take advantage of #DACA" - a program that requires recipients to be living in the U.S. as of 2012?
